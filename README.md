# Human Learning

> Machine Learning models should play by the rules, literally.

## Project Goal

Back in the old days, it was common to write rule-based systems. Systems that do;

Nowadays, it's much more fashionable to use machine learning instead. Something like;

We started wondering if we might have lost something in this transition. Sure,
machine learning covers a lot of ground but it is also capable of making bad
decision. We've also reached a stage of hype that folks forget that many
classification problems can be handled by natural intelligence too.

This package contains scikit-learn compatible tools that should make it easier
to construct and benchmark rule based systems that are designed by humans. You
can also use it in combination with ML models.

## Installation

You can install this tool via `pip`.

```python
python -m pip install human-learn
```

## Documentation

Detailed documentation of this tool can be found [here](https://koaning.github.io/human-learn/).

A free video course can be found on [calmcode.io](https://calmcode.io/human-learn/introduction.html).

## Features

This library hosts a couple of models that you can play with.


### Interactive Drawings

This tool allows you to draw over your datasets. These drawings can later
be converted to models or to preprocessing tools.

### Classification Models

#### FunctionClassifier

This allows you to define a function that can make classification predictions. It's
constructed in such a way that you can use the arguments of the function as a parameter
that you can benchmark in a grid-search.

#### InteractiveClassifier

This allows you to draw decision boundaries in interactive charts to create a
model. You can create charts interactively in the notebook and export it as a
scikit-learn compatible model.

### Regression Models

#### FunctionRegressor

This allows you to define a function that can make regression predictions. It's
constructed in such a way that you can use the arguments of the function as a parameter
that you can benchmark in a grid-search.

### Outlier Detection Models

#### FunctionOutlierDetector

This allows you to define a function that can declare outliers. It's constructed in
such a way that you can use the arguments of the function as a parameter that you
can benchmark in a grid-search.

#### InteractiveOutlierDetector

This allows you to draw decision boundaries in interactive charts to create a
model. If a point falls outside of these boundaries we might be able to declare
it an outlier. There's a threshold parameter for how strict you might want to be.

### Preprocessing Models

#### PipeTransformer

This allows you to define a function that can handle preprocessing. It's
constructed in such a way that you can use the arguments of the function as a parameter
that you can benchmark in a grid-search. This is especially powerful in combination
with the pandas `.pipe` method. If you're unfamiliar with this amazing feature, you
may appreciate [this tutorial](https://calmcode.io/pandas-pipe/introduction.html).

#### InteractivePreprocessor

This allows you to draw features that you'd like to add to your dataset or
your machine learning pipeline. You can use it via `tfm.fit(df).transform(df)` and
`df.pipe(tfm)`.

### Datasets

#### Titanic

This library hosts the popular titanic survivor dataset for demo purposes. The goal of
this dataset is to predict who might have survived the titanic disaster.

#### Fish

The fish market dataset is also hosted in this library. The goal of this dataset
is to predict the weight of fish. However, it can also be turned into a classification problem
by predicting the species.
