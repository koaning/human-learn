Why worry about state of the art,
maybe it's time that we all admit.
That one-size-fits-all suit,
is not bespoke and usually does not fit.

Computers can flow a lot of tensors,
but they never really learn.
Natural Intelligence is still a good idea,
and Artifical Stupidity a valid concern.

There are many ways to solve a problem,
but don't let fancy tools go to your head.
Why would you use a predefined solution,
if you can create a custom one instead.
