Computers are like calculators,
they never really learn.
Natural Intelligence is a pretty good idea,
and Artifical Stupidity a valid concern.

Why worry about state of the art,
maybe it's time that we all admit.
That one-size-fits-all suit,
usually does not fit.

There are many ways to solve a problem,
but don't let it go to your head.
Why would you use a predefined solution,
if you can customize one instead.
